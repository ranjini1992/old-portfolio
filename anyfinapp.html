            <p>Anyfin is a fin-tech startup which enables its customers to refinance their existing loans from other creditors to a new loan with a lower interest rate. My aims during the internship were to </p>

            <ul>
                <li> Make a customer journey map to discover the user goals, feelings and pain points at every stage. </li>
                <li> Design a mobile application experience for both potential and existing customers. </li>

        <div style="text-align:left; padding-left: 3em; padding-right: 3em">
            <p>I identified the following stages in the journey of any potential customer. For each stage, I listed the customer’s goals, the company’s goals, how the customer thinks and feels in that stage and possible opportunities to overcome their pain points.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>   Pre-Discovery (customers are paying loans to a different creditor at a higher interest rate)</li>
            <li>   Discovery (They see an ad to refinance their loan)</li>
            <li>   Research and consideration (“Is the effort worth it? How much will I save?”)</li>
            <li>   Apply for a refinancing of their loan with Anyfin</li>
            <li>   Post Apply (wait for an offer – Anyfin checks their credit history)</li>
            <li>   Offer of how much the interest rate can be reduced</li>
            <li>   Post Offer (They need to decide to take the offer or not)</li>
            <li>   Receiving first invoice/payment notice</li>
            <li>   Payment of invoice every month</li>
            <li>   Anyfin upsells to refinance their other loans</li>
            <li>   Completed all payments</li>

        <div style="text-align:left; padding-left: 3em; padding-right: 3em">
            <p> I created several prototypes to brainstorm how to help the potential customers visualize how they might benefit from refinancing and help the existing customers how their loan is being paid off each month. In the case of loan payments, it is essential to understand how much is being contributed to the principal (amortization) and how much is contributed to the interest payment. This would enable customers to plan their next payments and be financially empowered.</p>

            <p>
                Based on comments from existing customers in interviews and feedback from other stakeholders (development team and CTO), I came up with wireframes and flow for the mobile app along with the Growth lead. Here are a few of the screens which were later passed on to the designer for the hi-fi prototypes.
            </p>
             <p>The following images show the dashboard of invoices and payments to help existing customers get an overview of what’s their current loan balance and what is the minimum payment towards the loan for the month.</p>
            <img src="images/dashboard.png" width="40%" /><br><br>
            
            <p> Comparison of interest rates and monthly payment rates with their previous creditor and after they refinanced it with Anyfin.</p>
