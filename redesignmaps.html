            <p>I worked in a group with 3 other teammates and we conducted 8 interviews in the <b>critical incident technique</b> with users of Google Maps. Each interview took around 15 minutes and we asked the interviewee to narrate the last time they used Google Maps and break it down into details.</p>

         <b>Breakdown analysis</b>
         <p>We listed all the breakdowns from the interviews in which the users couldn’t use the app as designed or came up with clever ways to overcome something that didn’t work for them. Then, we grouped the breakdowns intro major categories.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>   Misinterpreted Commands - User searched for ATM and it showed a place called ATM outside the city, user searched for ‘games week' and it showed a night club instead of the event, user tried to use google assistance voice command (show me the way to get home) and it showed a song instead.</li>
            <li>Imprecise control – User searched for a mountain and it zoomed in too much and user couldn't estimate the distance, street view crashed and the icon was displaced after it unfroze, google maps couldn't find a user's exact location.</li>
            <li> Excessive steps - User typed a destination in google browser and went to more information to find the directions instead of searching on maps website. </li>
            <li> Unexpected routes - Maps showed an unsafe path through a forest at night, user tried to measure distance between two locations and the route went through buildings, user tried to go to a bar and exit the building but google maps kept telling the user to go back and exit a different way. </li>
            <li> No live updates -  User was in the metro and wanted to be sure not to miss the stop but couldn’t see the live location </li>

        <div style="text-align:left; padding-left: 3em; padding-right: 3em">
            <p>Based on the breakdowns listed above, we came up with a profile of a user who uses a map app frequently and wants reassurance along the way. We created a scenario of a marathon with road blockades. Three personas were created: a runner, running coach who wants to track the location of runners and a journalist who would like to navigate easily with voice commands.</p>

         <div style="text-align:left; padding-left: 3em; padding-right: 3em">
         <b>Research</b>
         <p>We searched for novel interaction techniques and found different types of menus (circular, marking, radial, dropdown), some solutions where users can mark spots on the route and the spots snaps to nearby roads. We came across an app called inRoute used for multi stop route planning, live weather update and search gas stations nearby. Google maps also has a lot of voice commands we didn't know about.</p>

        <div style="text-align:left; padding-left: 3em; padding-right: 3em">
         <b>Design Concept</b>
         <p>The design would help the personas draw and plan routes, find the way without looking at the phone and interact with other people on the way.  Some main interactions we wanted to use were haptic feedback for directions (turn left or right, move faster or slower), circular menus on tap and marking menus in freehand drawing of routes

        <div style="text-align:left; padding-left: 3em; padding-right: 3em">
            <p>
                We created a first prototype and showed it to 5 different users of Google maps and asked them for feedback and questions. We realised the following issues.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>  Too many live locations of runners can be hard to differentiate on a map: We thought of clustering them and when the cluster is tapped, it shows individual live locations. User can select multiple locations with two fingers. </li>
                 <li>  Haptic feedback can happen too often or for too long: We could limit it to 3 seconds</li>
                 <li>   Haptic feedback might not work inside a park or a forest path with elevation. So, we showed route elevation using colour feedback. </li>
                 <li>   Too many tap interactions can be too confusing for new users. So, we introduced shake interaction to move and reorient the map view.</li>
            </ul>
             <p>Then we improved the prototype and created a poster to indicate the updates in the design scenario and techniques.</p>

            <b>Conclusion</b>
            <ul>
                <li>We made routes interactive and reusable. We could make it more instrumental by allowing constraints (maximum distance) and remembering preferences. </li>
                 <li> We used drawing, marking menu and circular menus to interact with routes but almost all interactions were triggered by tap or long press. This can be confusing for new users. </li>
                 <li>  We focussed on planning routes (pre-event) and location tracking during event. However, we didn’t brainstorm enough about post-event interactions</li>
